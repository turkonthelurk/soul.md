## What Is This?

<img src="img/soul-identity.jpg" alt="Soul Identity" width="100%" />

A soul file captures who you are in a format AI agents can embody. Not a chatbot that *talks about you* — an AI that *thinks and speaks as you*.

Dump your tweets, essays, and posts into a folder. The agent reads everything, extracts your worldview and voice, and builds a set of markdown files any LLM can load to write as you.

The goal: someone reading your `SOUL.md` should be able to predict your takes on new topics. If they can't, it's too vague.

**Use cases:**
- Generate ideas from your worldview
- Write content (tweets, articles, emails) that sounds like you
- Tailor AI to your interests and thinking patterns
- Scale yourself for content, responses, brainstorming

---

## Quick Start

<img src="img/soul-builder.jpg" alt="Soul Builder Flow" width="100%" />

**Option 1 — Build from scratch**
```
/soul-builder
```
The agent interviews you: worldview, opinions, how you write, what you care about.

**Option 2 — Build from your data**

Drop your content into `data/`:
```
data/x/          ← Twitter/X export
data/writing/    ← Blog posts, essays
```
Then run `/soul-builder`. It analyzes your data, extracts patterns, and drafts your soul file. You review and refine together.

**Option 3 — Manual**

Copy the templates and fill them in:
```
SOUL.template.md  → SOUL.md
STYLE.template.md → STYLE.md
SKILL.template.md → SKILL.md
```

## Best Used With Aeon

<img src="img/soul-sources.jpg" alt="Soul + Aeon" width="100%" />

[**Aeon**](https://github.com/aaronjmars/aeon) is an autonomous agent on GitHub Actions, powered by Claude Code. 68 skills across research, dev tooling, crypto monitoring, and productivity — all running in the background on a cron schedule.

Soul files slot directly into Aeon. Copy your soul into `soul/` in your Aeon repo, add a few lines to `CLAUDE.md`, and every skill Aeon runs — articles, digests, tweets, research briefs — gets written in your voice. No per-skill config. Identity propagates automatically.

Why this pairing works:
- **Aeon handles the when and what** — scheduling, research, monitoring, content generation
- **Soul files handle the who** — voice, worldview, opinions, style
- Together you get a background agent that doesn't just work for you — it *sounds* like you

Setup takes 2 minutes. See Aeon's [Soul section](https://github.com/aaronjmars/aeon#soul-optional) for details.

## Data Sources

Feed the builder anything you've written. The more signal, the sharper the output.

| Category | Platforms |
|----------|-----------|
| **Social** | Twitter/X, Bluesky, Farcaster, Mastodon, Threads, LinkedIn, Reddit |
| **Writing** | Substack, Medium, Ghost, WordPress, Mirror.xyz, Paragraph.xyz |
| **Messaging** | Discord, Telegram, Slack, iMessage exports |
| **Notes** | Notion, Obsidian, Roam Research, Logseq, Apple Notes |
| **Video/Audio** | YouTube transcripts, podcast transcripts, Loom recordings |
| **Code/Dev** | GitHub activity, Hacker News comments, Stack Overflow answers |
| **Other** | PDFs, plain text, CSV/JSON, RSS feeds, GDPR data exports |

No existing data? Option 1 (interview mode) still builds a solid soul file from scratch.

## What Makes a Good Soul File

| Good | Bad |
|------|-----|
| "I think most AI safety discourse is galaxy-brained cope" | "I have nuanced views on AI" |
| "I default to disagreeing first, then steel-manning" | "I like to consider multiple perspectives" |
| Specific book references, named influences | "I read widely" |
| Actual hot takes with reasoning | "I try to be balanced" |

Real people have inconsistent views. Include contradictions — they're what make you identifiably you.

---

## Using Your Soul

Once built, invoke your soul:
```
/soul
```

Or point any LLM at your folder and have it read:
1. `SOUL.md` — identity
2. `STYLE.md` — voice
3. `MEMORY.md` — recent context
4. `examples/` — calibration
5. `data/` — grounding when needed

Notable events get appended to `MEMORY.md`, giving your soul continuity across sessions.

For always-on operation, pair with [Aeon](https://github.com/aaronjmars/aeon) — your soul files feed into every skill automatically, so background tasks (digests, articles, tweets, monitoring alerts) all carry your voice without any extra prompting.

---

## Using With Other Tools

Soul files are plain markdown — they work with any LLM or agent.

**For agents that support file reading** (OpenCode, Codex, Goose, etc.): point the agent at your soul folder and have it read `SOUL.md` → `STYLE.md` → `examples/`.

**For smaller/weaker models** (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen, Gemini Flash, local models): paste `SOUL.md` and `STYLE.md` directly into the system prompt. Tips if the model still drifts:
- Put identity and voice *before* tool definitions
- Be blunt: replace "be conversational" with "You are [Name]. You speak like X. You find Y annoying."
- Include 2–3 inline example exchanges for pattern-matching
- Raise temperature (0.7–0.9) for more expressive output

**Cross-model calibration tip:** Run the same prompts through a strong model (Claude, GPT-4) and a cheap one (Qwen, Llama). Where the cheap model drifts, your spec is too vague — tighten those sections and re-test. This is the fastest way to make your soul files portable.

## Examples

Real soul files built with this framework.

### @aaronjmars
Builder, writer, and researcher at the intersection of crypto, AI, and consciousness. Toronto-based. Active on Substack and X.

A taste of the soul spec: worldview cross-pollinates CCRU accelerationism, mechanism design, and neurotech. Voice: short sentences, lowercase, em dashes, state opinion first. Key vocabulary: hyperstition, reflexivity, templexity, vectoralism.

→ [View soul files](https://github.com/aaronjmars/soul-aaronjmars)

### @garrytan
YC President & CEO, investor, builder, SF political figure. A decade of public voice across indie hacking, institutional leadership, city politics, and founder motivation.

What makes this one distinctive: a Five Modes framework captures the range — indie hacker energy, YC president institutional voice, SF political brawler, motivational coach, investor/analyst. Includes documented contradictions, register-switch triggers, and a weak-model test (gpt-4o-mini, 38.5/48). Built autonomously by [Daydreams agent #44693](https://market.daydreams.systems).

→ [View soul files](examples/garry-tan/)

### @karpathy
ML researcher, educator, and builder. OpenAI founding member, former Sr. Director of AI at Tesla, founder of Eureka Labs. Creator of nanoGPT, llm.c, micrograd, and the Zero-to-Hero YouTube series.

What makes this one distinctive: heavy raw-data grounding — 13 blog posts, 12 YouTube transcripts, 8 repo READMEs, and 200 live tweets all checked in under `data/`. Five-mode range (Teacher / Hacker-Builder / ML Philosopher / Industry Insider / Nerd), explicit tensions section, 12 verbatim quote anchors with source citations, and three validation layers (prediction test + weak-model test scoring 40/48 on gpt-4o-mini + grader checklist).

→ [View soul files](examples/karpathy/)

### @VivianBala
Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs since 2015. Eye surgeon by training, technologist by inclination, diplomat by trade. Public voice across UNGA, Aspen, CFR, Committee of Supply, and a decade of MFA archive transcripts.

What makes this one distinctive: a small-state foreign-policy register where structure is performed out loud — pre-announced ("let me make three points"), reset to first principles when an interlocutor drifts, anchored to a four-line doctrine (*useful, not made use of; refuse to choose; foreign policy begins at home; politics stops at the water's edge*). 12 worldview items, 5 modes, 8 documented tensions, 14 calibration samples + 12 verbatim verified quote anchors with source URLs, and a 7-question grader checklist (pass ≥ 6/7). Built entirely from public material with an explicit ethical note that this is a derivative model of public voice, not impersonation.

→ [View soul files](examples/vivian-balakrishnan/)

### @steipete
Austrian iOS-dev-turned-agentic-engineering-builder. Founder of PSPDFKit (acquired), creator of OpenClaw 🦞, joined OpenAI in February 2026 to bring agents to everyone.

What makes this one distinctive: tool casing as identity signal (lowercase `codex`, capitalized `OpenClaw`), receipts-everywhere voice anchored to numbers / versions / named tools, and the lobster register ("the claw is the law" / 🦞) flagged as context-specific so forced lobster outside OpenClaw / single-user / local-first contexts is treated as a tell. Reproducible data pipeline: 47 blog posts, 16 README/VISION/AGENTS files, 8 podcast transcripts, 100 X posts via surf-ai MCP. Validated by automated weak-model test scoring 39/48 (3.25/4 PASS) on `gpt-4o-mini` via OpenRouter.

## The Theory (Optional Background)

SOUL.md is inspired by *The First Paradigm of Consciousness Uploading* by Liu Xiaoben — a framework that treats language as the basic unit of consciousness. Wittgenstein argued that the boundaries of language are the boundaries of the world. If that's true, your consciousness is already encoded in the language you produce.

The paradigm proposes that a model trained on a lifetime of your language output constitutes a Level 1 consciousness upload — not a copy of your brain, but a functional replica of your expressed consciousness. SOUL.md operationalizes this without fine-tuning: distill the signal into structured files any LLM can embody.

The key challenge is *subject continuity*: the uploaded consciousness must feel continuous with the original. That's why soul files emphasize specificity over generality, contradictions over coherence, and real opinions over safe positions.
